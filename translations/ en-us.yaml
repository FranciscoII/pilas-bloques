  descripcionAcercaDe:
    about: "About Pilas Bloques"
    app: "Pilas Bloques is an application to learn programming, specially developed for the classroom."
    challenges: "We offer challenges with different levels of complexity to introduce students into the universe of programming with blocks."
    blocks: "What does programming with blocks mean?"
    develop: "It means developing programs with actions and instructions introduced in blocks or predesigned units. The result of fitting blocks together is a program that solves the problem or challenge we offered."
    positive: "Why is this learning methodology positive?"
    concept: "Because each abstract <b>concept</b> associated with programming has its <b>visual</b> representation."
    difficulties: "Because it avoids the <b>difficulties</b> produced by the formal syntax of a <b>written</b> language (and the frustration when we make a mistake in writing!). The blocks are selected, dragged, fit together, and the task is ready."
    difference: "What makes Pilas Bloques different from the other tools?"
    learning: "The main difference is that this platform was created in <b>support of a didactic sequence</b> to learn programming at school."
    sequence: "What’s a didactic sequence?"
    plan: "It’s the plan by means of which teachers expect students to learn a topic. Pilas Bloques didactic sequence was created and tested by Argentine teachers and researchers. Nowadays, this proposal is being studied in depth and expanded. Learn more about the initiatives we are working on"
    whoCanDo: "Who can solve Pilas Bloques challenges?"
    activities: "These challenges can be solved by anyone, from a 3-year-old child to a 99-year-old adult ;) . However, at present
                we offer two Teachers’ Books as supporting material, targeted at the <b> elementary school </b>, so that children between 5 and 8 years old can take advantage of the activities of the First Cycle, and children between 9 and 12 years old will be able to take advantage of the activities of the Second Cycle."
    anyone: "And can anyone solve these challenges on their own?"
    tool: "This tool was thought as an <b>aid for the teacher and the student</b> along the teaching-learning process of Programming
          at school. In these didactic sequences, the <b>inquiry-based</b> self-learning methodology is fundamental. However, our recommendation is that the
          teacher serves as the <b>guide</b> and assists during the student’s learning process."

    anyDoubts: "In case of doubt, contact us at: "
